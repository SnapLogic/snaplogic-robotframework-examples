*** Test Cases ***
Export Assets From a Project
    [Documentation]    Exports pipeline assets from SnapLogic project to a local backup folder.
    ...    This test case creates a backup of all pipeline assets (pipelines, accounts, etc.)
    ...    by exporting them as a ZIP file to a local directory for version control,
    ...    disaster recovery, or migration purposes.
    ...
    ...    üìã PREREQUISITES:
    ...    ‚Ä¢ Pipeline and related assets exist in the SnapLogic project
    ...
    ...    üìã ARGUMENT DETAILS:
    ...    ‚Ä¢ Argument 1: project_path - Path of the project From which assets to be exported
    ...    (e.g., ${PIPELINES_LOCATION_PATH} = shared/pipelines or project_space/project)
    ...    ‚Ä¢ Argument 2: save_to_file - Local file path where the exported ZIP will be saved
    ...    (e.g., ${CURDIR}/src/exported_assets/snowflake_backup.zip)
    ...    ‚Ä¢ Argument 3: asset_types (Optional) - Type of assets to export
    ...    (default: All - exports pipelines, accounts, and all other assets)
    ...    Options: All, Pipeline, Account, File, etc.
    ...
    ...    üìÅ EXPORT LOCATION:
    ...    Files are exported to: ${export_dir}
    ...    This directory is automatically created and excluded from git

    ${PROJECT_PATH}    ${export_filename}    ${asset_types}

Import Assets To a project
    [Documentation]    Imports pipeline assets from a backup ZIP file into a SnapLogic project.
    ...    This test case imports    assets from a previously exported backup file,
    ...
    ...    üìã PREREQUISITES:
    ...    ‚Ä¢ Backup ZIP file exists (created by Export Pipeline Assets test case)
    ...    ‚Ä¢ Target project path exists in SnapLogic
    ...    ‚Ä¢ User has permissions to import assets to the target path
    ...
    ...    üìã ARGUMENT DETAILS:
    ...    ‚Ä¢ Argument 1: import_path - Target path in SnapLogic where assets will be imported
    ...    (e.g., ${PIPELINES_LOCATION_PATH}_restored or shared/imported_pipelines)
    ...    Note: This can be the same path (to restore) or different path (to migrate/clone)
    ...    ‚Ä¢ Argument 2: zip_file_path - Local path to the backup ZIP file to import
    ...    (e.g., ${export_dir}/snaplogic_assets_backup_<timestamp>.zip)
    ...    ‚Ä¢ Argument 3: duplicate_check (Optional) - Whether to check for duplicate assets
    ...    (default: false - allows overwriting existing assets)
    ...    Options: true (prevent duplicates), false (allow overwrite)
    ...
    ...    ‚ö†Ô∏è    NOTE: Importing to a NEW location (e.g., ${PIPELINES_LOCATION_PATH}_restored)
    ...    is recommended to avoid conflicts with existing pipelines.

*** Keywords ***
Setup Export Directory
    [Documentation]    Creates the export directory and generates a timestamp for unique filenames.
    ...    This keyword runs before all tests in the suite.
    ...    Creates: ${export_dir} directory under src/
    ...    Generates: timestamp in format YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS
    ...    Sets up safe defaults for variables that might not be defined
    Log    Setting up export directory: ${export_dir}

    # Create the export directory if it doesn't exist
    Create Directory    ${export_dir}
    Log    Export directory created: ${export_dir}

    # Generate timestamp for unique backup filenames
    ${current_time}=    Get Current Date    result_format=%Y%m%d_%H%M%S
    Set Suite Variable    ${timestamp}    ${current_time}
    Log    timestamp generated: ${timestamp}

    # Determine the export filename if it is empty (custom or timestamped) also make it as suite variable
    ${export_file}=    Set Variable If
    ...    '${export_file_name}' != '${EMPTY}'    ${export_file_name}
    ...    snaplogic_assets_backup_${timestamp}.zip
    Set Suite Variable    ${export_filename}    ${export_dir}/${export_file}
    Log    Export filename: ${export_filename}
