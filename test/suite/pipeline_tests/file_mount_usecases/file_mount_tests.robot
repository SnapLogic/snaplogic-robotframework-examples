Documentation       Test Suite for File Mount Protocol Demonstration
...                 This test suite validates file upload and processing capabilities using
...                 file:/// protocol with mounted directories in SnapLogic environment:
...                 â€¢ Upload files from mounted directories using file protocol
...                 â€¢ Import and execute pipelines that read/write from mounted locations
...                 â€¢ Demonstrate file access patterns between containers

################## FILE MOUNT PROTOCOL DEMONSTRATION ##################

Upload Files With File Protocol
    [Documentation]    Demonstrates uploading expression library files using file:/// protocol
    ...    from directories mounted in the SnapLogic Groundplex container
    ...    ðŸ“‹ ASSERTIONS:
    ...    â€¢ Files exist in the mounted directory path
    ...    â€¢ File protocol URLs are correctly formed
    ...    â€¢ Upload operation succeeds using file:/// protocol
    ...    â€¢ Files are accessible in SnapLogic project space
    [Tags]    file_mount    upload    regression
    [Template]    Upload File Using File Protocol Template

    # IMPORTANT: File paths depend on which container processes the file:// URL
    #
    # 1. If SnapLogic Groundplex processes the file:// URL:
    #    Use: /opt/snaplogic/test_data (this is where files are mounted in groundplex)
    #
    # 2. If Test Runner container processes the file:// URL:
    #    Use: /app/test/suite/test_data (this is where files are mounted in test container)
    #
    # Since the upload operation is initiated from the test container but processed
    # by SnapLogic, we need to use the path that SnapLogic (groundplex) can access:

    # === Using Groundplex mount paths (files are actually at this path in groundplex) ===
    file:///opt/snaplogic/test_data/actual_expected_data/expression_libraries/mount_poc_source.expr    ${ACCOUNT_LOCATION_PATH}
    file:///opt/snaplogic/test_data/actual_expected_data/expression_libraries/mount_poc_target.expr    ${ACCOUNT_LOCATION_PATH}

    # === From App Mount (always available - entire test directory is mounted) ===
    # file:///app/test/suite/test_data/actual_expected_data/expression_libraries/test.expr    ${ACCOUNT_LOCATION_PATH}

    # === Using CURDIR Relative Paths (resolves to mounted paths) ===
    # file://${CURDIR}/../../test_data/actual_expected_data/expression_libraries/test.expr    ${ACCOUNT_LOCATION_PATH}

Import Pipelines
    [Documentation]    Imports the file reader/writer pipeline that demonstrates
    ...    reading from and writing to mounted file locations
    ...    ðŸ“‹ ASSERTIONS:
    ...    â€¢ Pipeline file (.slp) exists and is readable
    ...    â€¢ Pipeline import API call succeeds
    ...    â€¢ Unique pipeline ID is generated and returned
    ...    â€¢ Pipeline contains file reader and writer snaps configured for mounts
    ...    â€¢ Pipeline is successfully deployed to the project space

Create Triggered_task
    [Documentation]    Creates a triggered task for the file mount demonstration pipeline
    ...    This task will enable the pipeline to be executed on demand
    ...    ðŸ“‹ ASSERTIONS:
    ...    â€¢ Task creation API call succeeds
    ...    â€¢ Task name and configuration are accepted
    ...    â€¢ Task is linked to the correct pipeline
    ...    â€¢ Task snode ID is generated and returned
    ...    â€¢ Task is ready for execution

Execute Triggered Task
    [Documentation]    Executes the file mount pipeline to demonstrate reading from
    ...    and writing to mounted file locations through SnapLogic
    ...    ðŸ“‹ ASSERTIONS:
    ...    â€¢ Task execution API call succeeds
    ...    â€¢ Pipeline runs without errors
    ...    â€¢ File reader successfully reads from mounted source location
    ...    â€¢ File writer successfully writes to mounted target location
    ...    â€¢ Task completes within expected timeframe
    ...    â€¢ No pipeline execution errors or timeouts
