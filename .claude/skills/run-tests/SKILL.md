## Agentic Workflow (Claude: Follow these steps in order)

### Step 1: Load the Complete Guide
```
ACTION: Use the Read tool to load:
{{cookiecutter.primary_pipeline_name}}/.claude/skills/run-tests/SKILL.md
```
**Do not proceed until you have read the complete guide.**

### Step 2: Understand the User's Request
Parse what the user wants:
- Run tests for a specific system?
- First time setup or subsequent run?
- With or without Groundplex management?

### Step 3: Provide Quick Answer First
For simple questions, give the command immediately.

### Step 4: Offer More Details If Needed
Only provide additional context if asked.
