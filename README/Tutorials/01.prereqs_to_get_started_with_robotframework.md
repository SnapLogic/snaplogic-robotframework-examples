# Getting Started with Robot Automation Framework


**Reference links for high level demo recording:** [Snaplogic Test Example Framework Overview](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ub-bQtmNfL_BiXGMb2k3ocRMGjfn0mhf/view?usp=drive_link)

## Prerequisites

**Repository:** https://github.com/SnapLogic/snaplogic-robotframework-examples

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SnapLogic/snaplogic-robotframework-examples.git
cd snaplogic-robotframework-examples
```

This repository contains all the necessary configurations, templates, and automation scripts. You'll be working from it throughout the entire setup and execution process.

## Pre-requisite knowledge


To make the most of this automation framework, we recommend having a basic understanding of the following technologies:
and go through this doc **[pre_execution_setup_requirements](https://github.com/SnapLogic/snaplogic-robotframework-examples/blob/main/README/Tutorials/02.pre_execution_setup_requiremements.md)**



### Docker & Containers
Understand how containerized environments work and how Docker is used to manage services.

### Robot Framework
Familiarize yourself with this open-source test automation framework. It's used for writing and executing the tests in this project.

### Make & Makefiles
Learn how make commands work and how Makefiles are structured. This project uses Makefile targets extensively to manage tasks.

## Step 1: Install Docker Desktop

Ensure Docker Desktop is installed and running on your system. It's essential for launching the containerized environment that powers the SnapLogic ML migration framework.

## Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

Start by copying the example environment configuration:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

The `.env` file contains all necessary configuration values. Update and extend it as needed:



## Step 3: snaplogic package

The `snaplogic-common-robot` library, which includes reusable Robot Framework keywords, is published to public pypi.



### robot.Dockerfile Key Steps:

1. Initializes a Python environment
2. Installs Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`


## Step 4: Understanding requirements.txt

This file lists all the Python dependencies, including `snaplogic-common-robot`, required to run the automation framework.

If your project needs additional tools or database drivers, add them here.

## Step 5: Launch the Tools Container

Run the following command to start the essential services:

```bash
make snaplogic-start-services
```

This step will also generate a new `.env` file with runtime-specific variables that can be reused in later stages.

## Step 6: Run the Full Automation Workflow

Once your environment is set up and the `.env` file is configured, run the following command to execute all automation steps:

```bash
make robot-run-all-tests TAGS="oracle" PROJECT_SPACE_SETUP=True # If you already have project space set up ready ignore the argument PROJECT_SPACE_SETUP=True
```

This command performs the full end-to-end automation flow, including:

- **Plex Creation** â€“ Sets up a new SnapLogic Plex
- **Groundplex Launch** â€“ Spins up and registers the Groundplex service
- **Project Space & Project Creation** â€“ Creates a new project space and project
- **Account Creation** â€“ Creates the necessary Oracle account in the defined location
- **Pipeline Import** â€“ Imports the specified `.slp` pipeline into the project
- **Triggered Task Setup** â€“ Creates a triggered task to execute the pipeline

Make sure the `.slp` pipeline file is ready and correctly referenced as mentioned in the prerequisites.
