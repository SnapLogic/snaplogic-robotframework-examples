# üöÄ Pipeline Execution: 5-Step Quick Start

[**üöÄ Reference link for Robot Framework complete documentation in HTML Format**](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/SnapLogic/snaplogic-robotframework-examples/blob/main/README/How%20To%20Guides/robot_framework_guides/html_docs/robotframework_kickstart.html)

## ‚ö° Step 1: Install Docker Desktop
Download and install Docker Desktop for your OS, start it, and verify installation with `docker --version`

**For Windows users:** Follow these additional instructions for running Docker commands:
- **[Windows WSL VS Code Setup Guide](../How%20To%20Guides/infra_setup_guides/windows_wsl_vscode_setup.md)** - Essential setup for WSL, Ubuntu, make commands, and VS Code integration on Windows

## üì• Step 2: Clone the Repository
Create a working directory and clone the GitHub repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SnapLogic/snaplogic-robotframework-examples
```

## üíª Step 3: Open Project (Either in IDE or Terminal)
Download VS Code (or any preferred IDE) and open the project folder, or work directly from terminal

## ‚öôÔ∏è Step 4: Configure Environment
Create New file `.env` at project root level
Copy the contents of `.env.example` to  newly created file `.env` and update env values as per project requirements:
make sure to delete all inline commenst in .env file during copying of .env.example
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
Then edit the `.env` file with your actual SnapLogic credentials, organization details, and project settings

## üèóÔ∏è Step 5: Build and Execute
Build your test environment using make commands:

### Case 1: Using Framework-Managed Groundplex (Local)
This option creates and manages a Groundplex for you automatically:

```bash
# Build the Docker containers for all servives that will run your tests
make start-services 
# Run the below command if you want to run only tools service and use external accounts for execution
make start-tools-service-only

# oracle tests
make robot-run-all-tests TAGS="oracle" PROJECT_SPACE_SETUP=True # Create projectspace,launch ground plex and Runs Robot tests with the "oracle" tag 

# - For Later executions If you already have project space set up ready ignore the argument PROJECT_SPACE_SETUP=True
make robot-run-all-tests TAGS="oracle" # run postgres to s3 tests (No need to have project_space_setup=false)
```

### Case 2: Using Existing Groundplex (No Groundplex Creation)
If you want to use a different/existing Groundplex and skip the Groundplex creation:

```bash
# Build the Docker containers that will run your tests
make start-services 
# Run the below command if you want to run only tools service and use external accounts for execution
make start-tools-service-only


# oracle tests using existing Groundplex
make robot-run-tests-no-gp TAGS="oracle" PROJECT_SPACE_SETUP=True

# For later executions with existing project space
make robot-run-tests-no-gp TAGS="oracle"
```

```bash
# when user gets the latest code there might be changes to requirement files or compose files. Run the below command
make clean-start
# or
make clean-start-tools

```

**Note:** When using `robot-run-tests-no-gp`, ensure your `.env` file has the correct `GROUNDPLEX_NAME` pointing to your existing Groundplex.

> **‚è±Ô∏è Note:** This creates a containerized environment with Robot Framework and all testing dependencies. The build process takes about 2-3 minutes.

### üìñ Understanding Robot Framework Commands

For a deeper understanding of the Robot Framework testing process and available commands:

- **‚öôÔ∏è [Robot Framework Make Commands Guide](../How%20To%20Guides/robot_framework_guides/robot_tests_make_commands.md)** - Comprehensive reference for all available make commands, parameters, and usage examples
- **üìö [SnapLogic Common Robot Library Guide](../How%20To%20Guides/robot_framework_guides/snaplogic_common_robot_library_guide.md)** - Explore the SnapLogic-specific Robot Framework library with reusable keywords and comprehensive documentation

These guides will help you understand what happens behind the scenes when you run the commands above and how to customize your test execution for different scenarios.

‚úÖ **You're all set!** Your SnapLogic Robot Framework testing environment is ready to go.

## What Happens After Execution

After executing the above commands, the following services will be launched automatically:

### üöÄ Services Started

- **Groundplex** is launched for SnapLogic pipeline execution.
- **Oracle Database** is started.
- **PostgreSQL Database** is started.
- **MinIO** (S3-compatible object store) is started and pre-configured.

### üöÄ Tests Are Executed
- **RobotFrameWork Tests** You'll see Robot Framework output showing each step. Look for green "PASS" messages.

  **In SnapLogic Org:** (Based on the values given in .env file)
   - Accounts are created
   - ProjectSpace is Created (If there is existing project space with the same name it will be deleted)
   - Project is Created
   - Pipeline is imported
   - Triggered task is created and Executed

### üìä Test Reports Generated
- **Reports Location:** After test execution completes, detailed test reports will be automatically generated under:
  ```
  ../SNAPLOGIC_RF_EXAMPLES2/snaplogic-robotframework-examples/test/robot_output
  ```
- **Report Files Include:**
  - `report.html` - Comprehensive test execution report with pass/fail status
  - `log.html` - Detailed execution logs with step-by-step information
  - `output.xml` - XML output for integration with CI/CD tools
- **Viewing Reports:** Open the HTML files in any web browser to view detailed test results, execution times, and failure analysis
