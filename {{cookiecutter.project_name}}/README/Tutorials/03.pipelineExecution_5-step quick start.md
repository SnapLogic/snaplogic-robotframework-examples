# 🚀 Pipeline Execution: 5-Step Quick Start

[**🚀 Reference link for Robot Framework complete documentation in HTML Format**](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/SnapLogic/snaplogic-robotframework-examples/blob/main/%7B%7Bcookiecutter.project_name%7D%7D/README/How%20To%20Guides/robot_framework_guides/html_docs/tabs/quickstart.html)

## ⚡ Step 1: Install Docker Desktop
Download and install Docker Desktop for your OS, start it, and verify installation with `docker --version`

**For Windows users:** Follow these additional instructions for running Docker commands:
- **[Windows WSL VS Code Setup Guide](../How%20To%20Guides/infra_setup_guides/windows_wsl_vscode_setup.md)** - Essential setup for WSL, Ubuntu, make commands, and VS Code integration on Windows

## 📥 Step 2: Clone the Repository
Create a working directory and clone the GitHub repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SnapLogic/snaplogic-robotframework-examples
```

## 💻 Step 3: Open Project (Either in IDE or Terminal)
Download VS Code (or any preferred IDE) and open the project folder, or work directly from terminal

## ⚙️ Step 4: Configure Environment
Create New file `.env` at project root level
Copy the contents of `.env.example` to  newly created file `.env` and update env values as per project requirements:
make sure to delete all inline commenst in .env file during copying of .env.example
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
Then edit the `.env` file with your actual SnapLogic credentials, organization details, and project settings

## 🏗️ Step 5: Build and Execute
Build your test environment using make commands:

### Case 1: Using Framework-Managed Groundplex (Local)
This option creates and manages a Groundplex for you automatically



```bash
# Change your directory to {{cookiecutter.project_name}}

cd ../snaplogic-robotframework-examples/{{cookiecutter.project_name}}
```

```bash
# Build the Docker containers for all servives that will run your tests
make start-services 
# Run the below command if you want to run only tools service and use external accounts for execution
make start-tools-service-only

# oracle tests
make robot-run-all-tests TAGS="oracle" PROJECT_SPACE_SETUP=True # Create projectspace,launch ground plex and Runs Robot tests with the "oracle" tag 

# - For Later executions If you already have project space set up ready ignore the argument PROJECT_SPACE_SETUP=True
make robot-run-all-tests TAGS="oracle" # run postgres to s3 tests (No need to have project_space_setup=false)
```

### Case 2: Using Existing Groundplex (No Groundplex Creation)
If you want to use a different/existing Groundplex and skip the Groundplex creation:

```bash
# Build the Docker containers that will run your tests
make start-services 
# Run the below command if you want to run only tools service and use external accounts for execution
make start-tools-service-only


# oracle tests using existing Groundplex
make robot-run-tests-no-gp TAGS="oracle" PROJECT_SPACE_SETUP=True

# For later executions with existing project space
make robot-run-tests-no-gp TAGS="oracle"
```

```bash
# when user gets the latest code there might be changes to requirement files or compose files. Run the below command
make clean-start
# or
make clean-start-tools

```

**Note:** When using `robot-run-tests-no-gp`, ensure your `.env` file has the correct `GROUNDPLEX_NAME` pointing to your existing Groundplex.

> **⏱️ Note:** This creates a containerized environment with Robot Framework and all testing dependencies. The build process takes about 2-3 minutes.

✅ **You're all set!** Your SnapLogic Robot Framework testing environment is ready to go.

## What Happens After Execution

After executing the above commands, the following services will be launched automatically:

### 🚀 Services Started

- **Groundplex** is launched for SnapLogic pipeline execution.
- **Oracle Database** is started.
- **PostgreSQL Database** is started.
- **MinIO** (S3-compatible object store) is started and pre-configured.

### 🚀 Tests Are Executed
- **RobotFrameWork Tests** You'll see Robot Framework output showing each step. Look for green "PASS" messages.

  **In SnapLogic Org:** (Based on the values given in .env file)
   - Accounts are created
   - ProjectSpace is Created (If there is existing project space with the same name it will be deleted)
   - Project is Created
   - Pipeline is imported
   - Triggered task is created and Executed

### 📊 Test Reports Generated
- **Reports Location:** After test execution completes, detailed test reports will be automatically generated under:
  ```
  ../SNAPLOGIC_RF_EXAMPLES2/snaplogic-robotframework-examples/test/robot_output
  ```
- **Report Files Include:**
  - `report.html` - Comprehensive test execution report with pass/fail status
  - `log.html` - Detailed execution logs with step-by-step information
  - `output.xml` - XML output for integration with CI/CD tools
- **Viewing Reports:** Open the HTML files in any web browser to view detailed test results, execution times, and failure analysis
