# DB2 Docker Compose Configuration
# 
# PLATFORM COMPATIBILITY:
# - Windows (x86_64): Works seamlessly with native performance
# - Linux (x86_64): Works seamlessly with native performance
# - macOS Intel (x86_64): Works seamlessly with native performance
# - macOS Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3): ❌ DOES NOT WORK - See details below
#
# ⚠️ CRITICAL LIMITATION FOR APPLE SILICON (M1/M2/M3) USERS:
# ====================================================
# DB2 CANNOT run in Docker on Apple Silicon Macs due to a fundamental incompatibility
# with shared libraries. The error you will encounter:
# "libicudatadb2.so.32: cannot enable executable stack as shared object requires: Invalid argument"
#
# This is NOT fixable through configuration changes. IBM has not provided ARM64-compatible
# images, and the x86_64 emulation cannot handle DB2's specific shared library requirements.
#
#
# ALTERNATIVES FOR TESTING DB2 ON APPLE SILICON:
# ==============================================
# 
# 1. IBM DB2 on Cloud (Recommended)
#    - Sign up at: https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/db2
#    - Free Lite tier available
#    - Connect from DBeaver/tests using cloud credentials
#    - Full DB2 compatibility
#
# 2. Remote Docker Host
#    - Set up Docker on a Linux server
#    - Use: export DOCKER_HOST=tcp://your-linux-server:2375
#    - Run: make db2-start (executes on remote host)
#
# 3. Alternative Hardware
#    - Use an Intel-based Mac
#    - Use a Windows or Linux machine
#    - Use a cloud VM (AWS EC2, Google Cloud, etc.)
#
# 4. GitHub Codespaces / Cloud Development
#    - Develop in a browser-based Linux environment
#    - Full Docker support with DB2
#
# WHAT THIS MEANS FOR YOUR TESTING:
# =================================
# - You CANNOT test DB2 locally on Apple Silicon Macs
# - You MUST use one of the alternatives above for DB2-specific testing
# - Do NOT assume other databases can replicate DB2 behavior
# - Consider using CI/CD pipelines on Linux for automated DB2 tests
#
# The 'platform: linux/amd64' directive forces Docker to use x86_64 emulation on ARM64 systems.
# This is necessary because IBM DB2 doesn't provide native ARM64 images, but it's not sufficient
# to make DB2 work due to the shared library issues.
